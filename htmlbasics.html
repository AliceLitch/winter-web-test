            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: 
            How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?

            Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. <strong>CSS is a style sheet
            language.</strong> CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.  For example, this CSS selects 
            paragraph text, setting the color to red: 
             
            <br/>
            <br/>
            p {
                <br/>
                color: red;
                <br/>
              }

              
          </p>
      </div>
      <div>
          <h2>
            Anatomy of a CSS ruleset
          </h2>
          <p>
            Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works :
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png" 
            width="600" height="300"
            />
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The whole structure is called a <strong> ruleset.</strong>(The term <i>ruleset</i> is often referred to as just <i>rule.</i>) Note the names of the individual parts:

            <br/>
            <h3 class="size">
                Selector
            </h3 >
            This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
                <br/>

                <h3>
                    Declaration
                </h3>
                This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's <strong>properties</strong> you want to style.
                <br/>
                <h3>
                    Properties
                </h3>
                These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
                    <br/>
                    <h3>
                        Property value
                    </h3>
                    To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the <strong>property value</strong>. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)  
                    <br/>
                    Note the other important parts of the syntax:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
                        <li> Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
                        <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>  
                    </ul>
          </p>
      </div>
